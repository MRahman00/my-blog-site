            <h2> Sakib Al Hasan</h2>
            <p class="text"> When the annals of Bangladesh cricket are sifted by future generations, Shakib Al Hasan will emerge and re-emerge as the greatest cricketer of its first two decades. As a bowler, Shakib is accurate, consistent and canny; aggression and a wide range of strokes are the keys to his batting. Even more importantly, he has self-belief and an excellent temperament, unflustered by the big occasion and ready to do battle against the top teams.

            The best of his ability and temperament were on display in his first Test as captain, against a weakened West Indies side in Grenada, when Shakib took eight wickets and scored an unbeaten 96 in a tense but successful fourth-innings chase of 215, leading Bangladesh to their first overseas series victory. In only his fourth Test as captain, Shakib scored 87 and 100 - his maiden Test century - in a losing cause against New Zealand in Hamilton, performances that offered further proof of his skill and ability to handle pressure. Against the same opponents in 2008, Shakib took 7 for 36 in Chittagong, only the second instance of a Bangladesh bowler taking seven or more wickets in a Test innings. <span class="moreText">
            
            In ODIs, Shakib's contributions have been equally vital with bat and ball and he became the first from Bangladesh to achieve the double of 2000 runs and 100 wickets. He also became the first batsman from Bangladesh to score five hundreds, despite mostly batting at No. 5.
            
            Being clearly the best player in the team, it wasn't surprising when Shakib was handed the captaincy in 2009 after Mashrafe Mortaza repeatedly got injured during his first tenure. His ability to perform consistently and to stay calm under pressure worked well for Bangladesh, as they won 22 out of 47 games under him, and even beat England in the 2011 World Cup. However, the World Cup campaign was followed by a disappointing tour of Zimbabwe, where Bangladesh lost a one-off Test and the ODI series, which led to Shakib's removal as captain.
            
            His form hardly waned, however, as he quickly bounced back to help Bangladesh bowl out West Indies for 61 in an ODI; a hundred and five-for in the same Test - something he has done twice - followed later in the year. He remained consistent for Bangladesh and his IPL team, Kolkata Knight Riders, but in 2014 Shakib lapsed into off-field shenanigans that saw him fined for lewdly gesticulating at the camera from the dressing-room during an ODI against Sri Lanka, then suspended for six months by the BCB for misbehaving with coach Chandika Hathurusingha and threatening to quit Bangladesh duty. The ban was lifted early and Shakib made the vice-captain in the ODI and T20 formats under Mashrafe. His match-winning ability was undimmed and he played key roles in Bangladesh wins during their stellar 2015.
            
            In the 2019 World Cup, Shakib hit his peak with the bat: playing the No. 3 role, he went past fifty in seven out of eight innings, with a lowest score of 41. That streak included two centuries, including an unbeaten 124 off 99 balls as Bangladesh chased down West Indies' 321 inside 42 overs - a record ODI chase for the country. Shakib finished the tournament third on the batting charts with 606 runs at 86.57, and also took a five-wicket haul against Afghanistan.
            
            The highs from that World Cup would dissolve shortly after. Shakib was suspended from all cricket for two years, with one year suspended, after accepting three charges of breaching the ICC's anti-corruption code. He was found guilty of not reporting approaches from bookies during series with Bangladesh as well as at the IPL during his time with the Sunrisers Hyderabad.
            
            The suspension would have effectively ended his chances of participating in the T20 World Cup in 2020, but the Covid-19 pandemic meant the tournament was postponed, and that a large part of Shakib's suspension went by without his missing too much cricket with the national team. Shakib was back in the set up soon after, and said he regretted and repented his actions, and that the suspension and the pandemic had made him rethink life.
            
            In 2021, he had another run-in with the authorities. This time, during the Dhaka Premier League. Playing for Mohammedan Sporting Club against Abahani Limited, Shakib was caught on video first kicking the stumps and remonstrating with the umpire after his lbw appeal had been turned down, and later ripping them out in anger after the umpire called for the covers when it had begun to rain. He was subsequently banned for three matches and fined Taka 5 lakh (USD 5800 approx).</span></p>

            <h2> Tamim Iqbal</h2>
            <p class="text">Tamim Iqbal was already one of Bangladesh's most assured batsmen at the time of his 21st birthday, and will be a vital component at the top of the order for years to come. His promise was apparent when, batting for the Under-19s against England at the end of 2005, he smashed 112 from just 71 balls to help Bangladesh cruise to victory. The left-hander is regarded as one of the most exciting prospects in Bangladesh cricket and is arguably the hardest hitter of the cricket ball in the country. His elegance and style through the off side is a treat to watch but his trademark shot is the straight drive, capped with a text-book like follow-through. <span class="moreText">

Tamim is the younger brother of Bangladesh international Nafis Iqbal Khan and nephew of former Bangladesh skipper Akram Khan. He made his one-day debut against Zimbabwe in February 2007 and was included in the World Cup squad after playing just two matches. His straight six off Zaheer Khan after skipping down the track was one of the best shots of the tournament. He scored a stylish 84 in his debut Test, against New Zealand in Dunedin and has since firmly established his spot at the top of the order. His maiden century came in 2009 against West Indies in St Vincent, a match-winning effort. He then set a national record against Zimbabwe in Bulawayo when he blasted an unbeaten 154 in a tall chase.

Tamim has found England's bowling attack particularly to his liking, and a superb run of form against them in two series, home and away, lead to five scores of more than fifty in six Test innings, culminating in his stunning 103 at Lord's in May 2010.</span>

            <h2> Mustafizur Rahman</h2>
            <p class="text">   Mustafizur Rahman is a left-arm pace bowler who came to Dhaka to try out for a fast-bowling camp in 2012, after he had impressed in an Under-17 tournament in Satkhira, some 300km from Dhaka. He got admitted to the BCB's pace foundation and soon caught the coaches' attention to make the Bangladesh Under-19 side for the 2014 World Cup.

He made his first-class debut for Khulna in the 2013-14 season and, after taking eight wickets in the U-19 World Cup in the UAE, he was surprisingly picked for Bangladesh A's tour of West Indies. Returning from that short trip, he was viewed as a better bowler and slowly picked up more variations. He initially lacked pace but built it up through the 2014-15 first-class season, when he took 26 wickets at an average of 19.08. <span class="moreText">

This was when Mustafizur started to develop the left-armer's offcutter, which was delivered as a spinner does but with the added ability of making it carry to the wicketkeeper standing back. The story of Anamul Haque's dare that got him to bowl the delivery will go into Bangladeshi cricket folklore, as will the early support he received from Mashrafe Mortaza, who spotted him randomly in the Mirpur nets.

Soon enough, the Bangladesh selectors picked Mustafizur for the one-off T20I against Pakistan and then, midway through 2015, for the ODI series against India when he became only the second bowler after Brian Vitori to take five-wicket hauls in his first two ODIs, paving the way for Bangladesh's first-ever ODI series win over India.

He was excellent in bilateral series against South Africa - which included a Test debut - and Zimbabwe, while also doing well in his first BPL campaign. Mustafizur's first foray on to the world stage was through the IPL auction, when he was picked Sunrisers Hyderabad in early 2016, followed by confirmation of a contract with Sussex for English domestic limited-overs cricket. He ensured none of his new paymasters doubted their call as he emerged as one of the best bowlers in the World T20, signing off with a five-wicket haul against New Zealand, bamboozling them with his variation of cutters.</span></p>

            <h2> Mushfiqur Rahim</h2>
            <p class="text">  A wild-card inclusion for Bangladesh's maiden tour of England in 2005, Mushfiqur Rahim was just 16 when he was selected for that daunting trip - two Tests in May, followed by six ODIs against England and Australia - even though he hadn't been named in the preliminary squad of 20. Mushfiqur was principally selected as an understudy to the ever-present wicketkeeper, Khaled Mashud, but his inclusion was further evidence of Bangladesh's determination to build for a better future. He had done well on an A-team tour of Zimbabwe earlier in 2005, scoring a century in the first Test at Bulawayo, and also enjoyed some success in England the previous year with the Under-19s, making 88 in the second Test at Taunton. He showed more evidence of grit with the full team, with a maiden first-class half-century to soften the pain of defeat against Sussex, followed by a career-best 115 against Northamptonshire. <span class="moreText"> That earned him a call-up - as a batsman - to become the youngest player to appear in a Test match at Lord's. He was one of only three players to reach double figures in a disappointing first innings, but a twisted ankle kept him out of the second Test. After captaining Bangladesh's Under-19s to fifth place in the Youth World Cup in February 2006, he also featured in Bogra's inaugural Test, against Sri Lanka the following month, but could make little of the spin of Murali and Malinga Bandara. He remained on the sidelines for the next few months but was recalled for the final two ODIs against Zimbabwe at home in December. He scored his maiden half-century at Harare in February 2007 and was picked as the first-choice wicketkeeper, ahead of Khaled Mashud, for the World Cup in the West Indies.

He shows sound technique in his glovework and is Bangladesh's first-choice wicketkeeper after Dhiman Ghosh's departure to the ICL. A stodgy lower-order batsman, Mushfiqur has grown into one of the better players of spin in the line-up. After a slow start to his Test career, he found form in the 2008-09 season with stubborn knocks under pressure. He has under-performed as a batsman in ODIs, but his form picked up in 2009 and he narrowly missed out on a maiden ODI hundred on the tour to Zimbabwe. In January 2010 he cracked his maiden Test century, a notable achievement as it came against a strong Indian Test side and was the fastest by a Bangladesh player. And after Bangladesh's unexpected defeat in Zimbabwe in 2011, Mushfiqur was also elevated to leadership role, taking over as captain from Shakib Al Hasan. </span></p>
